## Data sheets

System requires a Google Sheets API key - hardcoded

**All sheets must be public viewable** - set by clicking share and 'anyone with the link can view' - old style publishing is not required.

### Master Sheet
There is one hardcoded sheet id `1YAvN5y4QU9q37-z2KpI88lOFTKwLQd8aACNCnPW7JOs`- this is sheet that contains the username, passwords, and workshop sheet id
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YAvN5y4QU9q37-z2KpI88lOFTKwLQd8aACNCnPW7JOs/edit#gid=0

This is currently editable by George Strakov but will need to be updated to the 'final' master sheet.
